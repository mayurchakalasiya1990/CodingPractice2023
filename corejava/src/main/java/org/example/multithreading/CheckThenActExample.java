/*
If two or more threads call the checkThenAct() method on the same CheckThenActExample object,
then two or more threads may execute the if-statement at the same time,
evaluate sharedMap.containsKey("key") to true, and thus move into the body code block of the if-statement.
In there, multiple threads may then try to remove the key,value pair stored for the key "key",
but only one of them will actually be able to do it.
The rest will get a null value back, since another thread already removed the key,value pair.
